    "question": "What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?",
    "answer": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI framework that enhances large language models by retrieving relevant information from external knowledge sources before generating responses. This approach helps improve accuracy, reduce hallucinations, and provide up-to-date information.",

      {
        "content": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches in natural language processing. In RAG, an LLM first retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base and then uses this information to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses.",
